About Project
========================================
I spent so much time on the JS of this project that I never styled it. I'll go back and change that one of these days when I have more time.

How it was made:
============================================

JavaScript, Html


what I've learned
============================================
-I used onclick inside the html and I need to not do that because it violates seperation of concerns
-I need to come up with more effective problem solving strategies
